While running git init command, I have seen that my username is not figuring in the path returned after creating local folder or respository. I m getting return path as follows

Initialized empty Git repository in c:/Users/Sagar/Desktop/exercise/.git/ but in course it shown it should have user name as follows “Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/<username>/Desktop/extras/.git/”

All other things like commit push are working fine and i m able see my file on github, but concerned about username not figuring out in the path. Will this impact something?

Please note that my user is not Sagar as shown in path, its something different.

Also there is issue in question space, i m not able give spaces between words. Moderators pls check
